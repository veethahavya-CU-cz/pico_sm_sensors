- **Idle current:** 3 mA
- **Active current:** 60 mA
- **Active time:** 30 seconds every 10 minutes
- **Battery capacity:** 3000 mAh
- **Efficiency:** 80%

- **Usable battery capacity:**  
  Usable capacity = 3000 mAh × 0.8 = 2400 mAh

- **Time in one cycle (10 minutes):**  
  - Active time: 30 seconds  
  - Idle time: 570 seconds

- **Current consumption in one cycle:**  
  - Active consumption:  
    Active consumption = 60 mA × (30 s / 3600 s/h) = 0.5 mAh  
  - Idle consumption:  
    Idle consumption ≈ 3 mA × (570 s / 3600 s/h) ≈ 0.475 mAh  

- **Total current consumption per cycle:**  
  Total consumption ≈ 0.5 mAh + 0.475 mAh ≈ 0.975 mAh

- **Cycles per hour:**  
  Cycles per hour = 60 minutes / 10 minutes = 6

- **Total current consumption per hour:**  
  Total consumption per hour ≈ 0.975 mAh × 6 ≈ 5.85 mAh

- **Estimated battery life:**  
  Battery life in hours = 2400 mAh / 5.85 mAh/h ≈ 409.48 hours

- **Estimated battery life in days:**  
  Days ≈ 409.48 hours / 24 hours/day ≈ 17.06 days

- **Battery capacity:** 2400 mAh (usable)
- **Device consumption per hour:** 5.85 mAh
- **Device daily consumption:**  
  Daily consumption ≈ 5.85 mAh/h × 24 h ≈ 140.4 mAh

- **Solar panel output:**  
  - Current: 200 mA  
  - Voltage: 6V  
  - Charging circuit efficiency: 75%

- **Effective charging current:**  
  Effective current = 200 mA × 0.75 = 150 mA

- **Minimum sunlight hours to keep the device powered:**  
  140.4 mAh = 150 mA × Peak Sunlight Hours  
  Peak Sunlight Hours ≈ 140.4 mAh / 150 mA ≈ 0.94 hours (about 56 minutes)

- **Minimum sunlight hours to charge a fully depleted battery (3000 mAh):**  
  3000 mAh = 150 mA × Peak Sunlight Hours  
  Peak Sunlight Hours ≈ 3000 mAh / 150 mA = 20 hours

### Summary
- **Minimum sunlight hours to keep the device powered:** **Approximately 0.94 hours (or 56.2 minutes)**
- **Minimum sunlight hours to charge a fully depleted battery (3000 mAh):** **20 hours**
