- **Idle current:** 3 mA
- **Active current:** 60 mA
- **Active time:** 15 seconds every 15 minutes
- **Battery capacity:** 3000 mAh (assuming 2400 mAh usable)

- **Usable battery capacity:**  
  Usable capacity = 3000 mAh × 0.8 = 2400 mAh

- **Time in one cycle (15 minutes):**  
  - Active time: 15 seconds  
  - Idle time: 885 seconds

- **Current consumption in one cycle:**  
  - Active consumption:  
    Active consumption = 60 mA × (15 s / 3600 s/h) = 0.25 mAh  
  - Idle consumption:  
    Idle consumption ≈ 3 mA × (885 s / 3600 s/h) ≈ 0.738 mAh  

- **Total current consumption per cycle:**  
  Total consumption ≈ 0.25 mAh + 0.738 mAh ≈ 0.988 mAh

- **Cycles per hour:**  
  Cycles per hour = 60 minutes / 15 minutes = 4

- **Total current consumption per hour:**  
  Total consumption per hour ≈ 0.988 mAh × 4 ≈ 3.95 mAh

- **Estimated battery life:**  
  Battery life in hours = 2400 mAh / 3.95 mAh/h ≈ 607.59 hours

- **Estimated battery life in days:**  
  Days ≈ 607.59 hours / 24 hours/day ≈ 25.32 days

- **Battery capacity:** 2400 mAh (usable)
- **Device consumption per hour:** 3.95 mAh
- **Device daily consumption:**  
  Daily consumption ≈ 3.95 mAh/h × 24 h ≈ 94.8 mAh

- **Solar panel output:**  
  - Current: 200 mA  
  - Voltage: 6V  
  - Charging circuit efficiency: 75%

- **Effective charging current:**  
  Effective current = 200 mA × 0.75 = 150 mA

- **Minimum sunlight hours to keep the device powered:**  
  94.8 mAh = 150 mA × Peak Sunlight Hours  
  Peak Sunlight Hours ≈ 94.8 mAh / 150 mA ≈ 0.632 hours (about 37.9 minutes)

- **Minimum sunlight hours to charge a fully depleted battery (3000 mAh):**  
  3000 mAh = 150 mA × Peak Sunlight Hours  
  Peak Sunlight Hours ≈ 3000 mAh / 150 mA = 20 hours

### Summary
- **Sustained operation on a full charge without charging:** **~25 days**
- **Minimum (direct) sunlight hours to keep the device powered:** **~38 minutes**
- **Minimum (direct) sunlight hours to charge a fully depleted battery (3000 mAh):** **20 hours**
